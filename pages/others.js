                I am an inner researcher, at first sight. For the progress of mind and matter as a whole, I seek, attend, search, sit, wait and be silent etcâ€¦ This is a test that I am doing to myself. Actually, I do nothing, I only experience and observe. Witness this madness we call existence. We don't know anything. We know nothing and still, we have the will and wonder to calculate and test. To understand and flow in space-time. Because the thing I realized is mind and matter are in constant flux and flow. Just we need the observe it carefully. Full attention.

                I love to search about plants, spices, weird plants, and their different qualities. Love to cook with only my intuition and randomness.
