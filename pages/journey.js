                My personal coding journey is far more different, I guess. So, I've decided to write down this page, rather than a Curriculum Vitae.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is not easy to write down your experiences in life and convince someone that these moments are essential and that you are suitable for the job offered.
            </p>
            <p>
                The worst moment in my life is when I was walking on Kıbrıs Şehitleri street in İzmir, Alsancak. I was in my hometown but I was walking with hatred, stuckness and boredom. I've lost my mother, I was working in my father's job, 'nothing good can happen' I thought…
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, I saw a web development course on my right side and I signed up for it. That was the key moment that I made voluntarily and till that moment I am passioned about coding. I still kept this first excitement, the reason is it is not a job for me, and this is not a Curriculum Vitae, as I said before.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is very simple if you find something to do and you won't be bored of doing it, it is your lifetime job. You can earn money and you love to do your job so that you never work again. It is your hobby you are doing and someone willingly pays for its results, that's it!
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I will try to explain the journey by telling you the stack that I follow. It really doesn't matter the stack you follow, but as I've started with my journey, let's go and do it, anyway:
            </p>

            <ul className='mb-[24px] font-bold'>
                <li>

                </li>

                    Next
                </li>
                <li>
                    Node

                <li>
                    Express
                </li>
                <li>
                    MongoDB
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I am a full stack developer now and I am focusing on Web3 technologies. My aim is to work for other companies, improve myself on Decentralized Apps and then in my old age, I want to create my own company. Maybe!
